## Elected Quotes 

> "Anyone who has's had one of those experiences, in a country where it is not legal to have them, he's stuck in this position where something really precious and really giving, a great gift to you, is not understood by the culture at large and furthermore puts you and other people at the risk of prosecution.
> 
> And one response to that is to get angry. And to want to fight that. And another response to it is to say: we just have to explain to people what's going on here. And when people understand it, then there will be accommodation, and respect." ― from the movie: Fantastic Fungi


> “Maybe to be in a garden and feel awe, or wonder, in the presence of an astonishing mystery, is nothing more than a recovery of a misplaced perspective, perhaps the child’s-eye view; maybe we regain it by means of a neurochemical change that disables the filters (of convention, of ego) that prevent us in ordinary hours from seeing what is, like those lovely leaves, staring us in the face.”
― Michael Pollan



## Intro 

In the midst of the age of innovation, liberality, and new ideas, transparent education about (hard) drugs is still an unfortunate taboo. An important sub-group of these hard drugs are _psychedelics_. Psychedelics drugs have been used for centuries, potentially as long as they humans have existed in their modern form. The term psychedelic means "Mind manifestor”. In most regions of the world, [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) and [Psilocybin Mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin) are the most common substances of this group. Nonetheless, it contains many other substances used by indigenous people all around the globe. Even [MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) is considered to be psychedelic-like. 

In our current (deeply biased) culture, the term drug is tightly coupled with _irresponsible, recreational_ use. In this Jargon, the usage of a substance is a balance between (short-lived) desirable feelings (e.g. _high_, _drunk_) and adverse side effects (e.g. _addictiveness_, _hangover_). We happen to consider alcohol's adverse effects to be negligible (which is [very controversial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS6LoRYUdhw) by itself), so it is okay to use, while we think very differently about LSD, and it is illegal in most countries. 

This is a _wrong_, and more importantly, a very *limiting* perspective on these substances. 

Psychedelics on the other hand, have been shown in the last few years to have a different property: _healing_ and _self-development_, with very little adverse effects, when taken in a _safe_ and _controlled_ environment. A new era of research has begun, showing the use of these drugs to effectively cure PTSD, addiction to heroin, depression and many other mental disorders. Moreover, safe controlled usage could potentially lead to a boost in creativity, motivation, and a general sense of connectedness with the world around us. This is fundamentally different, and goes beyond the typical _recreational_ use of any substance. 

Finally, the usage of these drugs is somewhat common among computer scientist as well. It is only fair to openly speak about it.
