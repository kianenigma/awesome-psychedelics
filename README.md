The psychedelic forefront has gotten quite cluttered in the last few years.

- Targeted advertisements show it as the silver-bullet pill that is suddenly going to heal all your problems, boost creativity, productivity, athletic performance, and who knows, your face skin ü§Ø ü§•.
- On the other hand, pseudoscientific healing and mystical rituals are being treated credulously, not taking into account that ‚Äî with all due respect ‚Äî most of them lack *any* falsifiable and measurable evidence.

This list aim to serve as a *unbiased*, *evidence-based* resource about psychedelics and their potential **benefits**.

## Intro
In the midst of the age of innovation, liberality, and new ideas, transparent education about (hard) drugs is still an unfortunate taboo. An important sub-group of these hard drugs are _psychedelics_. Psychedelics drugs have been used for centuries, potentially as long as they humans have existed in their modern form. The term psychedelic means "Mind manifestor‚Äù. In most regions of the world, [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) and [Psilocybin Mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin) are the most common substances of this group. Nonetheless, it contains many other substances used by indigenous people all around the globe. Even [MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) is considered to be psychedelic-like.

In our current (deeply biased) culture, the term drug is tightly coupled with _irresponsible, recreational_ use. In this Jargon, the usage of a substance is a balance between (short-lived) desirable feelings (e.g. _high_, _drunk_) and adverse side effects (e.g. _addictiveness_, _hangover_). We happen to consider alcohol's adverse effects to be negligible (which is [very controversial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS6LoRYUdhw) by itself), so it is okay to use, while we think very differently about LSD, and it is illegal in most countries.

This is a _wrong_, and more importantly, a very *limiting* perspective on these substances.

Psychedelics on the other hand, have been shown in the last few years to have a different property: _healing_ and _self-development_, with very little adverse effects, when taken in a _safe_ and _controlled_ environment. A new era of research has begun, showing the use of these drugs to effectively cure PTSD, addiction to heroin, depression and many other mental disorders. Moreover, safe controlled usage could potentially lead to a boost in creativity, motivation, and a general sense of connectedness with the world around us. This is fundamentally different, and goes beyond the typical _recreational_ use of any substance.

Finally, the usage of these drugs is somewhat common among computer scientist as well. It is only fair to openly speak about it.
